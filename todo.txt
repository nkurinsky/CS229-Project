Currently know to-dos:
- Obtain data/investigate data structure
  - Can we get Cosmos/Hubble data from data challenge?
  - Assume N-band photometry and shape/resolution information, choose 2-3 ML methods
    - Supervised Discriminative: Regression, etc
    - Supervised Generative: GDA, etc
    - Other: SVM, etc
  - Establish training and classifying, what is truth, etc

Basically each person implements (at least) one method; we want to throw the book at this problem
